"""Tests for the ``conversations.terminal_launch_args`` column.

Per ``designs/NATIVE_RUNNER_SERVER_LAUNCH.md``: the column is a nullable
TEXT holding a JSON-encoded list of pass-through CLI args for a native
terminal wrapper (claude / codex). NULL means no native launch args —
the common case for non-native sessions and for rows that pre-date the
feature. These tests exercise the schema directly (raw SQL, no ORM) so
column drift is caught independently of the store wrapper.
