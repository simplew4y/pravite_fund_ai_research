"""
Unit tests for ``sys_timer_set`` and ``sys_timer_cancel`` (step 10
of the harness contract migration).

Covers the schema shape, argument validation, and ToolManager
registration gating — paths that don't require a running DBOS
workflow. The actual firing behavior (sleep + send +
auto-rendering) requires DBOS and is exercised by the server
integration suite.

Mirrors the structure of :mod:`tests.tools.builtins.test_async_inbox`,
which gates ``sys_call_async`` / ``sys_read_inbox`` /
``sys_cancel_async`` on ``async_enabled``. The timer family is
gated on ``timers``.
