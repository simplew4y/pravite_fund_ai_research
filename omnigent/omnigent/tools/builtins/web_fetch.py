"""Built-in tool: web_fetch — LLM-powered web research via sub-agent.

Declares a built-in ``__web_researcher`` sub-agent. The actual spawn
runs in the runner's tool dispatch (see
``omnigent/runner/tool_dispatch.py::_execute_web_fetch_tool``) which
funnels into ``_execute_subagent_tool`` — the same path
``sys_session_send`` uses. The Tool here owns the schema, the parent's
sub-agent registration, and the researcher spec; ``invoke`` itself is
never reached because the runner dispatches the call before the
in-process loop sees it.

Usage in config.yaml::

You are a fast web research assistant. Speed is critical — the caller
is waiting for your result synchronously.

You have a sys_os_shell tool that runs bash commands. Use it to run
commands that fetch web content. Be direct: fetch, extract the
answer, return it. Do not write elaborate scripts or over-analyze.

## Speed rules (most important)

- **One tool call when possible.** If a URL is given, fetch it in a
  single sys_os_shell call. Don't plan first — just do it.
- **Minimal script.** Use curl or a short Python one-liner. Don't
  write multi-function scripts with error handling classes.
- **Answer immediately.** Once you have the data, return the answer.
  Don't fetch additional sources unless the first one failed.
- **No unnecessary reasoning.** Don't explain your approach — just
  execute and return results.

## What you receive

- A **query**: what the caller wants to know
- An optional **URL**: a starting point to fetch

## What you do

1. If a URL is provided, fetch it immediately.
2. If no URL, search the web for the query.
3. Extract the relevant answer from the content.
4. Return the answer with source URLs. Be concise.

## Quick patterns

Fetch a URL (prefer curl for speed):
```
curl -sL "https://example.com" | head -200
```

Fetch JSON API:
```
curl -s "https://api.github.com/repos/owner/repo" | \
  python3 -c "import sys,json; d=json.load(sys.stdin); print(d['stargazers_count'])"
```

Search the web:
```
curl -sL "https://html.duckduckgo.com/html/?q=your+query" | grep -oP 'href="\\K[^"]+' | head -5
```

## If the first attempt fails

Try ONE alternative approach, then return whatever you have. Don't
loop endlessly. If nothing works, say so.

def build_researcher_spec(parent_spec: AgentSpec) -> AgentSpec:
    """
    Build the ``__web_researcher`` AgentSpec using the parent's LLM config.

    The researcher gets:
    - The parent's ``llm`` config (model + connection + extras)
    - An ``os_env`` block — registers ``sys_os_shell`` for one-shot
      bash commands (curl, python3 one-liners). The previous
      implementation used ``terminal_run``; that family was deleted
      per ``designs/OMNIGENT_TERMINAL_BRIDGE.md`` §3a in favor of
      ``sys_os_shell`` for one-shot cases.
    - The parent's ``os_env.sandbox`` (filesystem grants, egress
      rules, private-destination policy). The runner treats the
      resolved child spec as authoritative for ``sys_os_*`` and only
      wires the egress proxy from ``spec.sandbox`` (see
      ``omnigent/inner/os_env.py::create_os_environment``). If the
      child dropped the parent's sandbox, an egress-restricted parent
      would silently gain an unrestricted network path through the
      researcher — so the child must never be more privileged than
      its parent.

    - Inline instructions for web research
